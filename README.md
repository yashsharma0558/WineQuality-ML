# Wine-Quality-ML
This Python code explores machine learning models to predict wine quality. It trains and compares models including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). It also incorporates hyperparameter tuning and creates pipelines for streamlined model building. Finally, it explores ensemble models that combine predictions from multiple models for potentially better performance.
